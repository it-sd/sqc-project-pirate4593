# Media Master

Joe O'Connor(joconnor10)

My project is going to be a media library with information on movies, anime, and tv shows.
The information I will be using will include titles, cast lists, posters, awards, plot, and languages that they could be in.
I want to make this website so people don't have to search other streaming services to figure out where the show they want to watch is located.
