# 8 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

I chose this heuristic because I feel that as of now my project is very empty and blank. 
I think that I should decrease my use of minimalitic because I used it too much and have made my site too bland, it needs more details and images to get the user's attention.
I feel that this heuristic can be hard to use because you can never know when you have too little but you definitely know when you have too much. 
That's why my goal for this heuristic is to add more to my site so it doesn't feel as empty and blank.

# 3 User Control and Freedom

I picked this heuristic because when I browse my site I don't feel like I'm free to do as I please and and forced to only go in one place.
I know that's because I've only added one other page and I should add more pages to increase the user's freedom to go to more places in my site.
Another thing I could add is an account system for user's so they can save the movies or shows and add them if they aren't in the database.
My goal for this heuristic is increase my use of it so user's control and freedom contains more choices within the site.

# Color Palette

I chose these colors because I like having a dark background and the yellow goes well on black. When picking the other colors I wanted to stay true to my original design and 
have a lighter blue border around the main media content. When I was using these colors I noticed that I could use the blue and purple for the navigation and invert the colors 
when hovering over the links. I used both purples in the navigation and made the hovered navigation text the brighter purple to make it brighter for the user to see.

# Typography

Fonts Used:
* Helvetica
* Impact
* Lucida Sans
* Haettenschweiler

I chose these fonts because they seemed minimal and got the point I wanted get across to the user. I chose to use impact as the font for the title of the media objects becauses I felt the title of the media selected to be impactful and used lucida sans for the body text of the website because it was basic and minimal. I used Haettenschweiler for the main header because it needed to be different from the other headings but not too different. I used Helvetica as the navigation's font because it needed to be basic like the body text but it needed to be different.
