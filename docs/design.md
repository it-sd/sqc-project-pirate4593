# 8 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

I chose this heuristic because I feel that as of now my project is very empty and blank. 
I think that I should decrease my use of minimalitic because I used it too much and have made my site too bland, it needs more details and images to get the user's attention.
I feel that this heuristic can be hard to use because you can never know when you have too little but you definitely know when you have too much. 
That's why my goal for this heuristic is to add more to my site so it doesn't feel as empty and blank.

# 3 User Control and Freedom

I picked this heuristic because when I browse my site I don't feel like I'm free to do as I please and and forced to only go in one place.
I know that's because I've only added one other page and I should add more pages to increase the user's freedom to go to more places in my site.
Another thing I could add is an account system for user's so they can save the movies or shows and add them if they aren't in the database.
My goal for this heuristic is increase my use of it so user's control and freedom contains more choices within the site.
